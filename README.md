# reango-task-manager

This is preparation for an interview. The idea is to start from a skeleton backend (Django) and skeleton frontend (create-react-app), randomly generate a simple full stack app (CRUD), and see how fast I can implement a working prototype. Goal is 1 hour and 15 minutes. This took about 4 hours.
